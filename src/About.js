                    <p>
                        I have a background in music, performing the oboe and English horn for several years with the
                        Waterloo-Cedar Falls Symphony Orchestra.
                        I recently decided to change careers and embarked on my new journey to become a software developer.
                        Along the way, I earned an IBM certificate in full-stack software development.
                        I am excited to use my artistic inclinations and creativity to design and develop attractive and
                        functional apps and webpages.
                    </p>
