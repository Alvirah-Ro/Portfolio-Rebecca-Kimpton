                I am a dedicated professional with over 15 years of experience in customer service, now transitioning into a career in software and application development. 
                A quick and enthusiastic learner, I have pursued language studies in German, Russian, Swedish, and French, and I bring the same passion for learning to developing my technical skills. 
                I am eager to continue expanding my programming knowledge, grow on the job, and contribute to a collaborative team environment. 
                I am a strong problem solver with excellent communication skills, and I bring a positive attitude and a strong work ethic to help any company succeed.
