A personal portfolio website featuring my programming projects.  It also includes a short summary of my development journey along with a resume and contact information.

This project began as a basic HTML/CSS site which I later converted to a React application.  I used Bootstrap for all the layout and styling.

The original React code was forked from an IBM repository that was part of an online course I completed titled "Developing Front-End Apps with React".
