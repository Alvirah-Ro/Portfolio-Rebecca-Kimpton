                I am a dedicated professional with over 15 years of experience in customer service, now transitioning into a career in software and application development. 
                I recently completed the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate and am a quick, enthusiastic learner. 
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages — including German, Russian, Swedish, and currently French - simply for the challenge and joy of learning. 
                I bring this same curiosity and passion to developing my technical skills. 
                I’m eager to continue growing on the job, contribute to a collaborative team, and apply my strong problem-solving and communication abilities. 
                With a positive attitude and strong work ethic, I strive to support company success in any role.
