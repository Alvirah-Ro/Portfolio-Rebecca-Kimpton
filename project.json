    "longDescription1": "This portfolio is a React application using Bootstrap styling.  I originally created it with basic HTML pages and decided to migrate to React to provide extra functionality.  The change involved translating the HTML to JSX and creating the React components.",
    "longDescription2": "I wanted to be able to easily change which projects were featured on this portfolio, so I am using the GitHub API to fetch starred projects from my repositories.  I then wrote code to dynamically render the project images and details fetched from the API.",
    "longDescription3": "One of the biggest challenges was figuring out the most effective way to handle the routes in the navbar.  I added Router capability to my Nav component and defined my routes there as well.  This proved limiting when I wanted to reorganize some of my material, so I created a separate component for routes which I added to App.js.  I then used index.js to wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter."
